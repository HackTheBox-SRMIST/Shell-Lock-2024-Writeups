## Writeup 

This CTF Question is based on image analysis.
THe given file is an ad1 file
We Know, ad1 files are those generated by ftk imager, and can only be opened in ftk imager.
So, we will open the ad1 file in ftk imager
Now, We will see many files in the Image tree.
After looking through all of the unneccessary files, we get a folder with some pdfs
If we open the pdfs, they won't coz they are corrupted.
But, One of them opens, but is encrypted.
You can Use john to unlock it.
But there is no Flag there, but a QR Code.
Well, That is your flag.

SCAN IT !!
