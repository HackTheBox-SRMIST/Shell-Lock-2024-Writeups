## Writeup

Taking the "Caesar" as a keyword here, we can assume it to be a Caeser cipher that shifts alphabets in accordance to a key.

We can run a Caesar cipher bruteforce to find the key, the direction, and potentially, the flag.

Here, we can see that the key is 6, and the direction is right, and of course we get the flag!

## Flag
